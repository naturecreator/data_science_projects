    "# What is \"Machine Learning\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a field of study that gives the computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is considered as a subfield of artificial intelligence and can be thought of as a means to build models of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning helps us to understand data by building mathematical models. Let's say that we want to train a computer by feeding it with a given data set. Using this given data set we can predict the properties of a new dataset. For example, let's assume that we are training a computer by feeding it with 10000 images of cats and 10000 images of some other objects/data. We are going to convey the computer each time whether the image is of cat or something else. After the training session, now the computer should be able to recognize when a new image is shown or encountered if it is of a cat or not. All this is done with the help of algorithms.\n",

    "# Categories of machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Supervised learning_ : Models that are able to predict labels based on labeled training data. \n",
    "    * _Classification_: Models will predict labels as discrete categories(two or more).\n",
    "    * _Regression_: Models used to predict continuous lables. \n",
    "    \n",
    "* _Unsupervised learning_: Models have to identify patterns in the data that is unlabeled.\n",
    "    * _Clustering_: Division of elements into a number of groups/clusters such that elements of the same cluster are more                           similar to each other than to those from different clusters.   \n",
    "    * _Dimensionality reduction: Process of reducing the dimension of the feature set i.e., feature set could be a dataset or an                                  array of points."
